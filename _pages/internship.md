## Internship

My last internship was at HackDefense in Leiderdorp. HackDefense is a small pentesting company, where I learned about web applications and pentesting. For my second internship, I decided to go into a different direction, by going for a bigger company and focussing less on web applications. This turned out to be easier said than done, especially since lots of companies have stopped hiring due to COVID. I applied at some big companies, such as Fox-IT QBit and NorthWave. I heard nothing back from Fox-IT, QBit was a great match, but they decided last minute that they didn't want an intern and NorthWave didn't have an assignment that fitted both me and the company. Eventually, I got in contact with the owner of NNextSecure, a pentesting company in Breda. We met up first for just a chat and I was offered an internship or a job. At that time I had my faith in my current applications, but they all failed me. So I came back to the company and got an internship.

My assignment was luckily not about web applications, but IoT. This is a nice change of pace and I am looking forward to my internship.

## Future

I hope to keep working at NNextSecure after my internship. But eventually, I'd like to go into the read teaming. The top-tier part of the security, where you find yourself through a network, rather than finding an XSS. This does require a lot of experience, so I will keep working where I stand right now.
