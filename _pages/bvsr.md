title: Blue VS Red Event

## Introduction

The Blue VS Red event was organized for the application made by the security engineers to be tested by the red teamers, while the blue teamers monitor the network.
During this event the all students can test their skills and/or products in practice. The event is held three times, so that the changes can become apparent in between the events.

## First Event

The first event was on 26 october 2020. For this event we made a Discord server for all the red teamers. When we started we got a list of all applications to divide. Arjan, one of the red team students, dived the scope into the groups we had made. These groups then got to work on these given applications. The tests our group where pretty conclusive, because we had found nothing in the three applications. It was clear that the security engineers had focussed on the loginpage and did not add any functionality. Due to this, there was nothing to find.
