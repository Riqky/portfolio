My name is Rick Theeuwes, I study ICT & Cyber Security at Fontys Tilburg. My main course is Software Engineering, but I decided to finish on Cyber Security. Thus I am doing the Cyber Security Minor this semester. My home base is redteaming, because my internship was also in pen-testing. I take a great interest in exploitation and some reverse engineering. I also am a very active member on Hack The Box.

I choose the red teaming homebase, because I am very interested in finding and exploiting errors in systems. Of course this all to make the world a safer place, and to help companies protect their assets.
